\title{Reef fish diversity data}
\format{
A data frame with 55 rows and 6 columns. Each row corresponds to a different family and the variables are:
\describe{
  \item{Phyl_name}{String containing family and species names}
  \item{Spp_rich}{Species richness (number of species within the family)}
  \item{Divergence}{Maximum divergence in COI gene (an estimate for crown age)}
  \item{Egg}{Reproductive strategy with respect to eggs, with two states distinguished (pelagic or demersal)}
  \item{Egg_3}{Reproductive strategy with respect to eggs, with three states distinguished (pelagic, demersal or scatterer)}
