\description{
Data from an experiment where seeds from the Australian wildflower \emph{Senecio lautus} were collected, grown in glasshouses under uniform conditions, and a range of morphological traits measured. The seeds were collected from populations belonging to four distinct ecotypes (dune, headland, tableland and woodland) that may be in the process of forming separate species.
