# snevdata

This R package is a collection of datasets that have all been compiled
by researchers from the School of the Environment at The University of
Queensland (Australia). These datasets come in various formats and sizes
and have been compiled to help teach data science and programming using
R. All datasets have associated peer-reviewed scientific publications
that are referenced in the documentation. After installation, you can
call `library(help="snevdata")` to see a list of all datasets, and
`?<DATASET>` to get see the documentation for a specific dataset (e.g.,
`?nectarYeast`).
